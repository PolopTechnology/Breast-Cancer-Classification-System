# Breast-Cancer-Classification-System
THIS IS FOR PRACTICE PURPOSES ONLY. Project for a coding course.

This is a Breast Cancer Classification System made by us to
practice Support Vector Machines for Machine Learning. Factors are
undetailed and probably not realistic at all but it is meant as such.

Hope you enjoy and find it educational :)
